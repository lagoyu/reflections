When would you want to create a repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to share files to other people or other machines

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because changes you have made locally may conflict with changes made by others to the remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copies of GitHub repos on GitHub. They are used for beginning independent work based on someone else's repository
Clones are copies of repos made locally or from GH to a local machine. They are used as local copies of other repositories.
Branches are named sets of commits within a repository. Branches are used when there is a need to make use of/work on two different lines of development
