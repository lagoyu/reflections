How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It allowed me to focus in on just the lines which had changed. This is where the bug had to be introduced

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It will be easier to go back to earlier versions to get information which was deleted and  possibly follow my train of thought.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros
No proliferation of versions which are too small
Can include a note on reason for commit
Cons
May forget to commit at the best tim making a smaller change harder to restore on its own.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because version control systems like Git are designed to track changes across sets of files whereas the others are focussed on single files which stand alone.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log gives an overview of commits in the repo, whereas git diff allows comparison of two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I can go back to exactly the set of files prior to the change
I can see exactly what changes I made
